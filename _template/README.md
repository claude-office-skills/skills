# Skill Template

This directory contains a template for creating new skills.

## How to Use

1. Copy this entire `_template` folder
2. Rename it to your skill name (use kebab-case, e.g., `meeting-notes`)
3. Edit `SKILL.md` with your skill's content
4. Delete this README (or replace with skill-specific documentation)
5. Submit a PR

## Guidelines

### Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `expense-report`, `job-description`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Avoid generic names like `helper` or `assistant`

### Content

- **Be specific**: Solve one clear problem
- **Include knowledge**: Embed domain expertise, not just instructions
- **Show examples**: Real-world usage scenarios
- **Acknowledge limits**: Be clear about what the skill can't do

### Testing

Before submitting, test your skill:

1. Copy the SKILL.md content
2. Paste into a new Claude conversation
3. Upload a sample document
4. Verify it works as expected
5. Test edge cases
