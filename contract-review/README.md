## Risk Assessment

### 🔴 High Risk Items

#### 1. Unlimited Liability for Breach (Section 6.2)
- **Issue**: No cap on liability for breach of confidentiality
- **Impact**: Unlimited financial exposure in case of inadvertent disclosure
- **Recommendation**: Add a liability cap (e.g., direct damages only, capped at $1M)

### 🟡 Medium Risk Items

#### 1. Vague Return/Destruction Requirements (Section 4.1)
- **Issue**: "Reasonable efforts" standard is subjective
- **Recommendation**: Specify concrete timeframe (30 days) and certification

## Key Terms Summary

| Term | Value | Risk |
|------|-------|------|
| Confidentiality Period | 2 years + 3 years survival | 🟢 Low |
| Liability Cap | None specified | 🔴 High |
| Governing Law | Delaware | 🟢 Low |

## Recommendations

### Must Fix (before signing):
- Add liability cap for breach damages
- Narrow confidentiality definition with standard exclusions
